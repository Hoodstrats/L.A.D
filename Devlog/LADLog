The B.A.D app (borderlands automated database)(rename form borderlands farming companion)

[TODO]
- Remove farm label clicking functionality (remove it completely just havet he input box)
- Store the DATETIME in the config.json so when the user closes the program and reopens, the save doesn't get treated as a new day and the farms get put within the same day bracket
	- Currently when opening the program that session will be treated as a "new day"
- Do the clicks and all other events manually not with built in 
- Take into account the drop percentages set by the game according to mayhem level
	- Make them affect the drop calculations
- Make a HELP intro form. Displays how to use the program and some features etc.
	- Add checkbox that stores json variable to "SHOW MESSAGE AT STARTUP" 
- Clicking each label should let you edit the textbox value under like the farm label does

[MAYBES]
- Option to save the file as an excel file instead of text 
- Maybe add a check mark for each option in the config file that can be changed
- Make it that clicking the labels for each text box activates it like the farm name text
- Multi client info update ala online multiplayer (1 person updates for multiple sync)
- Checkboxes for individual settings in CONFIG INI 	
	(C:\Users\hoodstrats\Documents\My games\Borderlands 3\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\GameUserSettings.ini)

#Include this in the launcher
//This along with the yoinker and the snowball mute 
- Need version numbers in their build folders
- Need to include that in the google drive along with a zipped version of the files needed
- Uses Webclient class from C# kind of how we do in Unity with webrequest except we can download files async etc

[Notes]
- Might have to switch to WPF and use the material skin system that's actually up to date over there instead of winforms altogether
- Using the material skin causes a lot of issues with the basic functionality of some of the controls. Like disabling them doesn't work as intended. Some of the click functionalities are broken too.
- Radio buttons are meant to be used with multiple selections that way you can turn one off and the other on etc 
	- Checkboxes are much easier to use in WINFORMS for true/false
Icon sizes : 256 x 256


		
Borderlands App
For the borderlands program use MATERIAL skin to redo the ui
- Implement the EXCEL export feature and organize it into color coded columns depending on amount of drops etc
	- Green would be a good run to drop ratio
	- Red would be bad 
	- Split the excel into dates like the notepad 
	
	

MATERIAL SKIN (seems to work with WinForm)
https://github.com/IgnaceMaes/MaterialSkin

The B.A.D app (borderlands automatic database)
- Make it using the material skin and have "tabs" one for the main program and one that displays a list essentially displays the information in the farmlog.txt except organized into a spreadsheet format

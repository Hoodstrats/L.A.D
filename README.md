### This is a simple app I made to help keep track of my farm runs in Borderlands. I designed the app to accomplish just a couple tasks. Here are the key features I added and neeeded to have.
    - Elapsed timer to keep track of total time spent farming "X"
    - Track the name of the weapon/enemy you're currently farming
    - The amount of runs you've done
    - The amount of drops 
    - The amount of drops you've kept
    - Automatically calculate the drop percentage based on runs and drops.
    - Create a text file to help organize you're data
